## üéØ Overview

This project is a research tool for studying BLE advertisements from "Find My" type devices. It provides real-time monitoring and analysis of tracking device advertisements, helping researchers understand device behavior, advertisement patterns, and manufacturer-specific implementations.

The scanner operates passively, capturing and decoding BLE advertisements without connecting to or interfering with the target devices.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-Manufacturer Support**: Detects devices from Apple, Google, Samsung, and Xiaomi
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous scanning with live output
- **Flexible Filtering**: Enable/disable specific manufacturers
- **Detailed Analysis**: Decodes both manufacturer data and service data
- **Passive Scanning**: Non-intrusive monitoring that doesn't interfere with devices
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed information about detected devices

## üõ† Hardware Requirements

### Supported ESP32 Boards

- **ESP32-S3** (recommended for better performance)
- **ESP32-WROOM** (standard ESP32)
- **ESP32-U** (compact variant)

### Minimum Specifications

- ESP32 microcontroller with BLE support
- USB connection for serial monitoring
- 3.3V power supply

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) IDE or CLI
- USB cable for ESP32 programming
- ESP32 development board

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexandreprates/FindMyScanner.git
   cd FindMyScanner
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pio lib install
   ```

3. **Select your board environment**
   - For ESP32-S3: `esp32-s3`
   - For ESP32-WROOM: `esp32-wroom`
   - For ESP32-32U: `esp32-32u`

4. **Build and upload**

   ```bash
   # For ESP32-S3
   pio run -e esp32-s3 --target upload

   # For ESP32-WROOM
   pio run -e esp32-wroom --target upload
   ```

5. **Start monitoring**

   ```bash
   pio device monitor
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Manufacturer Filtering

Edit the filter constants in `src/main.cpp` to enable/disable specific manufacturers:

```cpp
// Filter by Manufacturer type:
constexpr bool FILTER_APPLE   = false;  // Apple (AirTag, Find My)
constexpr bool FILTER_GOOGLE  = true;   // Google (Fast Pair)
constexpr bool FILTER_SAMSUNG = true;   // Samsung (SmartTag)
constexpr bool FILTER_XIAOMI  = true;   // Xiaomi (Anti-Lost)
```

### Scan Parameters

Adjust scanning behavior by modifying these parameters:

```cpp
// Scan interval and window (in 0.625ms units)
scan->setInterval(80);  // 50ms
scan->setWindow(70);    // ~43.75ms

// Passive vs Active scanning
scan->setActiveScan(false);  // true for scan response requests

// Duplicate filtering
scan->setDuplicateFilter(false);  // true to filter repeat advertisements
```

## üìä Usage

1. **Power on** your ESP32 board
2. **Open serial monitor** at 115200 baud rate
3. **Wait for initialization** - you'll see the filter status
4. **Observe real-time output** as devices are detected

### Example Session

```text
BLE scan started!

=== Filter by Manufacturer ===
Apple:   DISABLED
Google:  ENABLED
Samsung: ENABLED
Xiaomi:  ENABLED
============================

Google   FastPair/FindDevice  | 7b:59:8d:19:f3:a9 | RSSI -46 | PDU NONCONN | Service [11 01 8D 97 54 8D]
Samsung  SmartTag            | a1:b2:c3:d4:e5:f6 | RSSI -52 | PDU NONCONN | Manufacturer [75 00 01 A3 B4]
```

## üìà Output Format

Each detected device is displayed with the following information:

```text
[Manufacturer] [Device Type] | [MAC Address] | RSSI [dBm] | PDU [Type] | [Connectivity] | [Data Type] [Hex Data]
```

### Field Descriptions

- **Manufacturer**: Apple, Google, Samsung, Xiaomi, or Other
- **Device Type**: Specific device classification (e.g., AirTag, SmartTag, FastPair)
- **MAC Address**: Bluetooth device address (often randomized)
- **RSSI**: Received Signal Strength Indicator in dBm
- **PDU Type**: Advertisement PDU type (NONCONN, ADV_IND, etc.)
- **Connectivity**: CONN (connectable) or NONCONN (non-connectable)
- **Data Type**: Source of detection (Manufacturer or Service data)
- **Hex Data**: Raw advertisement data in hexadecimal format

## üîß Technical Details

### BLE Advertisement Analysis

The scanner analyzes two types of BLE advertisement data:

1. **Manufacturer Specific Data**: Company-specific advertisement format
2. **Service Data**: Standardized service UUID-based advertisements

### Detection Logic

- **Apple Find My**: Detects type 0x12 (AirTag) and 0x10 (offline finding) in manufacturer data
- **Google Fast Pair**: Identifies service UUID 0xFEF3 with type 0x11 for Find My devices
- **Samsung SmartTag**: Recognizes types 0x01 (SmartTag) and 0x02 (SmartTag+) in manufacturer data
- **Xiaomi Anti-Lost**: Detects type 0x30 in manufacturer data

### Privacy Considerations

- This tool is for educational and research purposes only
- Respects device privacy by operating in passive mode
- Does not attempt to connect or communicate with target devices
- Does not store or transmit personal data
